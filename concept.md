# README Revision Concept

## The Wonton Metaphor

The name "Wonton" is intentional. Like its namesake:

- **Thin wrapper** — minimal API surface
- **Savory filling** — useful functionality
- **Delicate but satisfying** — lightweight but complete
- **Serve in soup** — drops into your larger project
- **Enjoy on its own** — works standalone too

The repo lives under `deepnoodle-ai`, so leaning into the culinary theme makes sense.

## Approach: Option 1 + 2 Hybrid

Keep the clean, scannable structure (tables, clear headings for reference sections) but punch up the intro, certain headers, and the FAQ with "Full Dim Sum" energy.

The metaphor should feel like seasoning, not the main dish.

## Specific Changes

### Title + Tagline

**Current:**
```
# Wonton

A batteries-included toolkit for building CLI tools, terminal UIs, and AI agents in Go.
```

**Proposed:**
```
# Wonton 🥟

A savory, batteries-included toolkit for building CLI tools, TUI dashboards, and AI agents in Go.
```

### Opening Hook

**Current:**
> Wonton consolidates 18 packages into a single module...

**Proposed:**
> Wonton wraps 18 essential packages into a single, savory module. Like a well-made dumpling, it holds everything together in a delicate but sturdy wrapper. Import just the filling you need, or use the whole thing—it's all designed to cook perfectly together.

### Section Header Changes

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| Why One Module? | Why One Wrapper? |
| Examples | Serving Suggestions |

Keep these **unchanged** (functional, easy to scan):
- Terminal UI
- CLI Framework
- Web & Networking
- Utilities
- Testing & Recording

### "Why One Wrapper?" Section

Opportunities for light seasoning:

- "No mystery meat, just pure Go" — supply chain transparency point
- "Farm-to-table dependencies" — minimal external deps
- "The flavors blend perfectly" — integration/versioning point

### FAQ: "Why Wonton?"

**Current:**
> Small, self-contained, and goes well with everything.

**Proposed:**
> Like its namesake: thin wrapper (minimal API surface), savory filling (useful functionality), delicate but satisfying (lightweight but complete). Serve in soup (your larger project) or enjoy on its own.

## What NOT to Change

- Package tables — keep clean and functional
- Code examples — no food puns in code
- Requirements section — straight facts
- Contributing section — keep professional
- Sub-category headers (TUI, Web, etc.) — "Plating & Presentation" is clever but adds friction when scanning

## Tone Guidelines

- One emoji max (🥟 in title)
- Playful in prose sections, professional in reference sections
- The metaphor is a wink, not a theme park
- Someone skimming should still find what they need
- Someone reading the intro should get a smile

## Lines to Potentially Use

- "No mystery meat, just pure Go"
- "Farm-to-table dependencies"
- "Stop foraging for loose ingredients"
- "The prep work is done"
- "Everything you need in one bite"
- "Pairs well with: tight deadlines, ambitious demos, AI agents that need to eat the web"
